# Classifying Dogs and Cats using CNN 

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of dogs and cats using **TensorFlow 2.x**. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of both categories, showcasing deep learning techniques for image classification.  

## 📌 Features  
- **Dataset:** Dog vs Cat Classification Dataset  
- **Preprocessing:** Image rescaling, augmentation (shear, zoom, flip)  
- **Model:** CNN built with TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Training:** Uses GPU acceleration for better performance  
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy and loss metrics  


##  Dataset  
The dataset consists of:  
- **8,005 training images**  
- **2,023 testing images**  
- **Classes:**  
  1. 🐶 Dog  
  2. 🐱 Cat
 
## 📊 Results  
The trained CNN model successfully classifies dogs and cats with high accuracy.
